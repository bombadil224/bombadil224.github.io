# Why Jefimenko's shadow

After years of studying physics and mathematics I have developed a view of theoretical physics that I think is slightly out of the norm. This all started when I first read the book ["Electromagnetic retardation and theory of relativity"](https://www.amazon.com/Electromagnetic-Retardation-Theory-Relativity-Classical/dp/0917406249?crid=26C6M3IQATKWW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WjD5regcmB80V1zXKxOi3ZKNkcR0gu4Q1zQujZQSRZY.3e7s7CZix_SwY1MP1ticpKwPBUbCfPFFqdQ4yH2dmDA&dib_tag=se&keywords=Electromagnetic+retardation+and+theory+of+relativity&qid=1747586159&sprefix=electromagnetic+retardation+and+theory+of+relativity%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-1) by Oleg D. Jefimenko, and expanded all the more when I communicated with Richard D. Stafford author of ["The Foundations of Physical Reality"](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Physical-Reality-Richard-Stafford/dp/1938819101?crid=1TISOWETKB4L9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EzL1HThYAFASGNsO-lxJPu_P3_amxBx6BlNMPWlCVpTSr2xwoReKwQs-zEyhmheDigQkfqAh3Aodxpq_009JmL1a3eBs1jKHpjK4pYWeDDyRDYVfgBTTjVTIIPk4Yq2g9J_IKnKBZ-0aa2JhJgZVc0vIG4EBIENKZ1QBOV9jugIAR1JDK259ecrCc51C2wMUo2Q-1RrODr7p2sGcQbf5-1B7dNsr3YcgXM3eN6Koyik.b2EYYDijc9TJkCnHKTT8RTdntIUuvjE8P3TaxO_qDrk&dib_tag=se&keywords=foundations+of+physical+reality&qid=1747585977&sprefix=foundations+of+phisical+reality%2Caps%2C247&sr=8-1). Since then my prospective has expanded quite a bit and I want to see if anyone else understands things the same way.

I also want to try and take the next step, and expand on what I have found, if only in pointing at some holes and saying whats this and how do we get around it.

There is not much that I plan to say about physics that will be an easy read unless you already know a good deal of math and physics. If you don't know at least one of these this may be a harsh place to get an introduction to the other. But hopefully it will be well worth any effort put in.

If you do know some physics already and feel like there must be more to the story, or you have a good understanding of math and physics and just want to try a different prospective of electrodynamics out, or feel like something is just a little bit off with the way that you understand physics, and want to know if anyone else feels the same way, then this may be just what you are looking for.

Be warned much of what I am going to say may not not be the standard approach and my way of doing things will likely not be the normal way of doing things. I hope that this will be taken well.

My approach will be to stick to the mathematics and try to understand just what it is saying, the way that I see it "mathematics is a language and the Lagrange of physics is mathematics" as long as you can speak the Lagrange the only point of disagreement should be in our interpretation of what is being said.

Unfortunately there will be disagreements also because we will assume different things to be true about the universe. If we can't agree on where we should start, or where we did start then we are most likely going to wind up at different places or at least not agree on why we got there, the only way around this is if we can prove that what we are saying is equivalent, or if we can prove that something is unnecessary to assume in the first place. Of course if something is unnecessary then we should not assume it to be true.

Finally we must be careful to distinguish between "what is proven", "what has not yet been proven", "what is being assumed" and what is "not even wrong"!
If we can do that then any point of disagreement is just an opinion, and we should be willing to except when we are disagreeing for one of these reasons.
